### Tenant Improvement (TI) Billing

**Tenant Improvement Allowance (TIA) Structure**

**What is TIA?**
- **Definition**: Budget landlords allocate to tenants for customizing/upgrading commercial spaces
- **Who Provides**: Landlord typically provides; size and conditions negotiated in lease
- **Ownership**: Landlord provides, tenant uses for space customization

**Calculation Methods**

**Fixed Dollar Amount**
- **Range**: Typically 25%-150% of total first year's rental payments
- **Common Expression**: Dollar value per square foot (e.g., $20/sq ft)
- **Example**: $15/sq ft TIA on 5,000 sq ft space = $75,000 total allowance

**Percentage of Rent**
- **Alternative**: Calculated as percentage of total rent
- **Simplicity**: Often converted to real dollar figure for clarity

**Disbursement Methods**

**Direct Payment to Contractors**
- **Process**: Landlord pays contractors directly as work completed
- **Tenant Advantage**: No cash flow burden on tenant
- **Landlord Control**: Landlord verifies work before payment

**Reimbursement to Tenant**
- **Process**: Tenant pays contractors, landlord reimburses
- **Requirement**: Receipt of lien waivers and documented expenses crucial
- **Cash Flow Burden**: Tenant must have enough cash to pay contractors until reimbursed

**Combination/Line of Credit**
- **Hybrid**: Mix of direct payment and reimbursement
- **Flexibility**: Addresses different project phases

**Payment Timing**

**Lump Sum After Completion**
- **When**: Total TIA paid once project finished
- **Tenant Requirement**: Must have cash on hand to pay contractors during construction
- **Risk**: Extended cash flow exposure

**Amortized Over Rent Payments**
- **When**: TIA amount spread across multiple rent payments
- **Duration**: Depends on amount and lease term
- **Advantage**: Reduces upfront landlord cash requirement

**Milestone-Based**
- **Best Practice**: Payments tied to completion of work phases
- **Verification**: Landlord verifies completion before each payment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects both parties

**Contractor Payment Considerations**
- **50% Deposit Common**: Electrical contractors may require 50% deposit to secure project after proposal acceptance
- **Payment Upon Completion**: Generally paid once work completed
- **Contract Terms Critical**: Terms must be clear and agreed upon upfront to avoid misunderstandings

**Cost Overrun Responsibilities**
- **TIA is Maximum**: Landlord contribution capped at agreed amount
- **Example**: $15/sq ft TIA, tenant spends $20/sq ft → landlord pays only $15/sq ft
- **Contingency Plan Required**: Lease should specify who pays overruns and if capped
- **Typical Responsibility**: Tenant pays anything beyond TIA unless pre-negotiated

**Accounting Treatment**
- **Not Operating Expense**: Typically capitalized and amortized over lease life
- **Spread Over Years**: Cost distributed over several years, not deducted in full in year made

**Alternative Financing**
- **SBA Loans**: Small Business Administration loans available
- **Amortized TI Allowance**: Borrow from landlord, repay within lease term
  - Maximum loan detailed in lease
  - Tenant pays back after project complete

### Lighting Retrofit Structures

**Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs)**

**Overview**
- **Definition**: Alternative financing mechanism authorized by US Congress to accelerate investment in cost-effective energy conservation
- **Key Feature**: Allows organizations to accomplish energy savings projects without upfront capital costs
- **Guarantee**: Contains contractually-guaranteed savings by Energy Service Company (ESCO)
- **Financing**: 100% of energy saving project can be financed with low-interest rate financing

**How It Works**
- **Self-Funding**: Pay for project directly from energy savings
- **Reallocation**: Simply reallocate current energy expenses, no capital expense required
- **Project Threshold**: Most suitable for commercial retrofit projects exceeding $1 million
- **Outsourcing**: Owner outsources installation, project management, maintenance, savings measurement/verification to ESCO

**Financing Mechanisms**
- **On-Balance Sheet**: Most ESPCs backed by loan, capital lease, or bond issuance
- **Dodd-Frank Impact**: Post-2010, ESCOs can't arrange financing unless SEC-registered
- **Typical Funding Sources**: Customer must fund via cash on hand or through lender

**ESCO Role and Value**
- **Main Differentiator**: Guarantee of energy savings specified in ESPC terms
- **Extensive Experience**: Design and implementation of multiple efficiency measures
- **Risk Mitigation**: Technical and performance risks managed
- **Financial Guarantee**: Lenders receive assurance that energy savings will cover debt service
- **Project Integration**: Acts as project developer integrating design, financing, installation, operations
- **Contract Terms**: Typically 7-20 years depending on measures installed

**Financing Options**
- **Tax-Exempt Bonds**: Municipal or public sector projects
- **Non-Recourse Private Placement**: Project debt not tied to organization's balance sheet
- **ESCO Equity Investment**: Combined with customer financing
- **PACE Programs**: Property Assessed Clean Energy for commercial, industrial, multi-family
  - Low-cost financing paid over time through property tax assessment
  - Similar structure to performance contracting

**Global Management Performance Contracts (GMPCs)**
- **Subset of ESPCs**: Relatively new option for street lighting
- **Maintenance Coverage**: New equipment plus existing street lighting remaining in system
- **ESCO Financing**: ESCO provides financing of ongoing costs
- **Risk Management**: ESCO carries all credit and performance risks
- **Baseline**: Uses existing O&M costs as baseline
- **Independence**: Doesn't rely on owner's borrowing power

**State Program Example: New York Power Authority**
- **Program Age**: Offering Energy Services Program for 32 years
- **Investment (1987-2019)**: Over $3.1 billion across 6,953 facilities in NYS
- **Services Include**: Feasibility studies, engineering design, life-cycle cost analyses, equipment procurement, contractor labor, project financing

**Performance-Based Procurement**
- **Mechanism**: Leverages energy and operational savings to finance building retrofit/renewal
- **No Net Cost Increase**: Designed for public entities to upgrade at no net cost
- **Implementation**: Energy/operational savings from efficient equipment and best practices finance the project cost

- **Regional Variation**: Depends on local utility rates and solar production

**Contract Lengths**
- **Range**: 6-25 years
- **Typical**: 20 years most common

**Tax Credit Allocation**
- **Who Claims**: Company claims 30% federal tax credit (system owner)
- **Homeowner Benefit**: Competitive providers pass savings to homeowner as lower $/kWh rates
- **2025 Update**: Third-party ownership (48E credit) still available through end of 2027, even though residential 25D expires Dec 31, 2025

**Comparison to Lease**
| Feature | PPA | Lease |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Payment Type | $/kWh produced | $/month fixed |
| Production Risk | You pay for actual output | Fixed payment regardless |
| Weather Impact | Lower bill if less sun | Same bill regardless |
| Escalators | 1-5% common | 1-3% common |

**Ownership and Maintenance**
- **Ownership**: Company owns panels
- **Maintenance**: Company handles all maintenance, repairs, monitoring

### EPC Milestone Structures

**Typical EPC Payment Schedule**

**Contract Execution / Mobilization**
- **Percentage**: ~10% of full price
- **Trigger**: Execution of contract or satisfaction of conditions precedent
- **Purpose**: Mobilization, initial engineering, permits

**Construction Milestones**
- **Structure**: Tranches of full price paid when relevant milestones met
- **Typical Milestones**:
  - Foundation completion
  - Structural/racking installation
  - Module delivery and installation start
  - Electrical rough-in
  - Inverter installation
  - Substantial completion
- **Payment Timing**: On completion (not commencement) of scope items
- **Fairness**: Should allow contractor to remain "cash neutral" throughout build

**Substantial Completion**
- **Definition**: Most important milestone - solar plant complete and functional (capable of generating electricity) except for punch list items and interconnection
- **Typical Payment**: Majority of remaining balance (minus retainage)
- **Negotiated**: Developer also negotiates series of interim milestones on critical path

**Retainage**
- **Percentage**: 5%-10% of contract value
- **Hold Duration**: Until handover/Provisional Acceptance achieved
- **Alternative**: If no performance/warranty bond, may postpone last 5% until after warranty period expires (usually 24 months after PAC)

**Provisional Acceptance Certificate (PAC)**
- **Trigger**: System commissioned and operational
- **Punch List**: Minor items may remain
- **Payment**: Releases retainage or most of retainage

**Final Acceptance**
- **Timing**: After warranty period (typically 24 months) or punch list completion
- **Final Payment**: Any remaining retainage released

**Key Contract Terms**
- **Milestones**: Must be clear, measurable, and tied to completion
- **Critical Path**: Payment schedule aligned with critical path items
- **Bankability**: Payment structure must satisfy project lenders
- **Basis Reduction**: ITC requires reducing depreciable basis by half ITC amount (e.g., 30% ITC = 85% depreciable basis)

### Interconnection Milestone Payments

**2025 Interconnection Challenges**

**Queue Backlog**
- **Total Capacity**: Over 2.6 terawatts of generation and storage seeking grid connection
- **Context**: More than 2x total installed capacity of existing US power fleet
- **Growth**: 30% increase since 2023
- **Solar Projects**: Over 1,080 GW of total capacity in queue
- **Success Rate**: Only 14% of solar projects historically complete interconnection successfully

**Timeline Impact**
- **Multi-Year Wait Times**: Some states report extended delays
- **Utility Constraints**: Staffing limitations, outdated review workflows, ballooning project volumes
- **Result**: Longer timelines from application to Permission to Operate (PTO)

**Financing Tied to Interconnection**

**Contingent Financing**
- **Structure**: Financing milestones tied to interconnection approval rather than fixed dates
- **Risk Management**: Protects developer and lender from queue delays
- **Typical Milestones**:
  - Interconnection application submitted
  - System Impact Study complete
  - Interconnection Agreement signed
  - Permission to Operate (PTO) received

**Hedging Strategies**
- **Purpose**: Protect against commodity price exposure during extended development
- **Tools**: Module price locks, financial hedges, index-based contracts

**2025 Federal Reforms**
- **Expected Impact**: Cut EPC project timelines by 6-12 months
- **Benefits**: Faster approvals, cost savings, fewer interconnection bottlenecks
- **Timeline Reduction**: Utility-scale projects previously 3-5 years could see significant reduction
- **Predictability**: More predictable grid connection timelines for EPCs

**Payment Structure Considerations**
- **Hold Milestones**: Some payment milestones may be held pending interconnection approval
- **Contingency**: Developer may include interconnection contingency in contract
- **Risk Allocation**: Contract specifies who bears risk of interconnection delay (time and cost)

### ITC/MACRS Benefit Allocation

**2025 Federal Tax Incentives for Commercial Solar**

**Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**
- **Base Rate**: 30% tax credit for qualified commercial solar installations
- **Adders Available**:
  - **+10% Domestic Content**: Using US-manufactured components
  - **+10% Energy Community**: Project located in designated energy community
  - **Potential Total**: Up to 50% ITC with both adders

**CRITICAL 2025 UPDATE: One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB)**
- **Signed**: July 4, 2025
- **New Deadline**: Projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 OR be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to remain eligible
- **Timeline Shortened**: Significant reduction from original Dec 31, 2032 sunset
- **Urgency**: Developers must move quickly to capture ITC

**MACRS Depreciation Changes**

**Pre-OBBB (Before July 4, 2025)**
- **5-Year MACRS**: Solar property classified as 5-year property for depreciation
- **Bonus Depreciation**: 100% in first year OR spread over 5 years
- **Basis Reduction**: Depreciable basis reduced by 50% of ITC (e.g., 30% ITC = 85% depreciable basis)

**Post-OBBB (After July 4, 2025)**
- **100% Bonus Depreciation Intact**: Businesses can still fully deduct qualifying solar and storage assets in first year
- **5-Year MACRS Removed**: No longer option to spread deductions over multiple years using MACRS specifically for solar
- **2025 Bonus Depreciation**: 40% of depreciable basis in first year
  - Example: 30% ITC reduces basis to 85%, then 40% of $85,000 = $34,000 first-year deduction
  - Remaining 60% ($51,000) depreciated over remaining term

**Tax Benefit Allocation Between Investors and Developers**

**Tax Equity Structure**
- **Common Model**: Developer uses construction financing, sells completed project to tax equity investor
- **Investor Captures**: Investment Tax Credit (ITC) + MACRS accelerated depreciation
- **Buy-Back Provision**: Often included after tax benefits used
- **Partnership**: Tax equity investor must be partner when solar property placed in service (ITC only allocated to partners as of placement date)

**Partnership Allocations**
- **Pass-Through**: For businesses structured as partnerships or multi-member LLCs, credit passes through to individual partners based on ownership percentages
- **Special Allocations**: May be possible with proper documentation
- **Strategy**: Partners with limited tax appetite can sell their allocation to partners with higher tax liability
- **Maximization**: Optimizes overall benefit to business entity

**Residual Method of Allocation**
- **Valuation**: Recent decisions (Alta case) indicate Residual Method should be used to allocate purchase price for ITC eligibility
- **Asset Classes**: Allocation between tangible/intangible assets, goodwill, going concern value
- **Appraisal Impact**: Advisors and appraisers re-examining methodology

**Tax Credit Transferability (New Feature)**
- **Transferability**: Updated ITC allows credits to be sold to other taxpayers
- **New Financing Pathways**: Developers can attract private-sector investment by selling credits
- **Liquidity**: Creates more liquidity in market
- **Geographic Flexibility**: Projects in different areas can move forward even if developer lacks federal tax liability
- **Market Impact**: Opening new capital sources beyond traditional tax equity

## 6. UTILITY INCENTIVE STRUCTURES

### Instant Rebate Handling

**What is an Instant Rebate?**
- **Definition**: Rebate applied at point of sale, reducing upfront cost immediately
- **vs. Mail-In Rebate**: Customer doesn't wait for check/credit after purchase
- **Installer Receives**: Rebate reimbursement from utility after installation verified

**How It Works**
1. **Customer Quoted**: Price with instant rebate already deducted
2. **Installation Complete**: System installed and inspected
3. **Installer Submits**: Rebate claim to utility with documentation
4. **Utility Reimburses**: Installer receives rebate funds from utility
5. **Customer Benefit**: Lower upfront cost, no waiting for rebate

**Examples by Program Type**

**Electrical Panel Upgrades**
- **Reading Municipal Light (MA)**: Rebate issued as bill credit (not instant, but streamlined)
- **Max Incentive**: Not to exceed 50% of total installed costs

**EV Chargers**
- **New Jersey**: Up to $250 for purchase and installation of Level 2 charger

**Solar and Battery**
- **Varies by Utility**: Some utilities offer instant rebates at point of sale, others require post-installation application

**Austin Energy Example**
- **Solar Rebate**: $2,500 upfront rebate for qualifying residential solar installations
- **Instant**: Applied at time of installation

### Rebate Assignment Agreements

**What is a Rebate Assignment Agreement?**
- **Purpose**: Allows rebate to be assigned directly to installer, reducing homeowner upfront costs
- **Process**: Homeowner signs agreement assigning rebate rights to installer
- **Installer**: Claims rebate directly from utility/program administrator
- **Benefit**: Homeowner gets instant price reduction without waiting for rebate check

**Typical Use Cases**
- **Utility Rebates**: Especially for solar, batteries, heat pumps, insulation
- **Federal/State Programs**: Some programs allow assignment, others require homeowner to claim
- **Third-Party Ownership**: In leases and PPAs, leasing company automatically claims rebates as system owner

**Legal Structure**
- **Written Agreement**: Homeowner authorizes installer to claim rebate on their behalf
- **Documentation**: Must meet utility/program requirements
- **Verification**: Installation must be verified/inspected before rebate paid
- **Recourse**: If rebate denied, agreement typically specifies who bears risk

**Example Flow**
1. Homeowner signs contract for solar installation at $30,000
2. Utility offers $3,000 rebate
3. Homeowner signs rebate assignment agreement
4. Installer charges homeowner $27,000 (price minus rebate)
5. After installation verified, installer submits rebate claim to utility
6. Utility pays installer $3,000 directly

**Important Considerations**
- **IRS Requirements**: For federal tax credits, system must be installed AND operational by deadline (not just signed quote)
- **Form Required**: Specific utility or program may have standard rebate assignment form
- **Verification**: Installation must pass inspection before rebate released
- **Risk Allocation**: Agreement should specify what happens if rebate denied or reduced

**Third-Party Ownership (TPO) Arrangements**
- **Leases and PPAs**: Leasing company owns system, automatically claims rebates and tax credits
- **Homeowner Benefit**: Lower monthly payments due to company capturing incentives
- **No Assignment Needed**: Company owns system outright, so no assignment required
- **Through 2027**: 48E tax credit (TPO) available through end of 2027 even though residential 25D expires Dec 31, 2025

### SREC Registration and Sales

**What are SRECs?**
- **Definition**: Solar Renewable Energy Credit - tradable certificate representing renewable attributes of electricity generated from solar
- **One SREC**: Earned for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of solar electricity produced
- **Separate from Electricity**: SREC is separate from the electricity itself; you sell both

**States with Active SREC Markets (2025)**
- **Active Markets**: Ohio, Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington D.C.
- **Eligible Border States**: Kentucky, Michigan, Indiana, West Virginia (can sell in another state's marketplace)
- **Moved to Alternative Programs**: Some states (NJ, MA) moved on from traditional SRECs but still pay solar owners through successor programs

**SREC Price Range (May 2025)**
- **Lowest**: $2.50 in Ohio
- **Highest**: $415 in Washington, D.C.
- **High Variability**: Prices change frequently based on supply/demand

**SREC Prices by State**

**Washington, D.C.**
- **Value**: Over $300 per SREC (best SREC program)
- **Policy Driver**: CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018
  - Renewable energy mandate: 100% by 2032
  - Solar mandate: Expanded from 5% to 10% by 2041
- **Robust Market**: One of strongest SREC markets in United States

**Ohio**
- **Range**: ~$3.50 - $4 per MWh
- **Low Value**: Relatively low compared to other states

**Pennsylvania**
- **Value**: Lower than D.C., NJ, MA
- **Impact**: Still improves solar payback period vs. states without SRECs

**New Jersey & Massachusetts**
- **Status**: Moved on from traditional SREC markets
- **Current**: Pay solar owners through alternative programs

**How SREC Prices Are Determined**

**Supply and Demand**
- **Market-Based**: Value determined by supply/demand constraints
- **Buyers**: Electricity suppliers needing to meet solar RPS requirement
- **Price Cap**: Typically capped by Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) - fine paid by suppliers for every SREC they fall short
- **State Volume Impact**: States with large solar installations see lower SREC prices (oversupply)

**Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**
- **Driver**: State RPS requirements create demand for SRECs
- **Solar Carve-Out**: Portion of RPS must be met specifically with solar
- **Compliance**: Utilities must purchase SRECs or pay penalty
- **Market Size**: Determined by state's solar carve-out percentage and electricity consumption

**Registration Process**

1. **Install Solar System**: System must be operational and producing electricity
2. **Register with State/Regional Program**: Varies by state
   - PJM-GATS (Mid-Atlantic states)
   - NEPOOL-GIS (New England states)
   - State-specific registries
3. **Meter Certification**: Production meter data verified
4. **SREC Issuance**: Program issues SRECs based on verified production (typically monthly)
5. **Sell SRECs**: Through aggregator, broker, or direct to utility

**Sales Methods**

**Aggregator/Broker**
- **Service**: Company handles registration, tracking, sales
- **Fee**: Typically percentage of SREC value or flat fee
- **Convenience**: Hands-off for homeowner
- **Examples**: SRECtrade, Sol Systems

**Direct to Utility**
- **Long-Term Contract**: Lock in price for multiple years
- **Stability**: Predictable revenue
- **Potentially Lower Price**: May sacrifice upside for certainty

**Spot Market**
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Sell at current market rate
- **Volatility**: Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand
- **Potential Upside**: Can capture high prices during shortage

**Key Resources**
- **SRECtrade**: Comprehensive information on current market rates
- **DSIRE Database**: State-by-state incentive information
- **State PUC Websites**: Official program details and registration

**States Without SREC Programs**
- **Examples**: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona
- **Indication**: Less favorable solar conditions or alternative incentive approaches
- **Alternative**: May have other incentives (tax credits, rebates, net metering)

### Net Metering Credit Structures

**What is Net Metering?**
- **Definition**: Billing mechanism that credits solar owners for electricity they add to grid
- **Process**: When solar system produces more than home uses, excess sent to grid
- **Credit**: Homeowner receives credit on electric bill for excess production
- **Usage**: Credits applied to future bills when consumption exceeds production

**Types of Net Metering Credit Structures (2025)**

**Full/Traditional Net Metering**
- **Credit Rate**: Retail electricity rate (1:1 value)
- **Example**: Excess kWh exported at 3pm credited at same rate as kWh consumed at 8pm
- **States**: Many states still offer traditional net metering
- **Trend**: Some states moving away to successor programs

**Modified/Successor Net Metering**
- **Structure**: Credits at less than retail rate
- **Rationale**: Utility argues exported power has different value than consumed power
- **Example**: California NEM 3.0, Arizona, Michigan successor programs
- **Complexity**: May vary by time of day, season, or avoided cost

**Net Billing (NEM 3.0 in California)**
- **Direct Use**: Solar energy used to power home valued at full retail rate
- **Exported Energy**: Sent to grid credited at lower rate
- **Time-Varying**: Export credits change hourly, adjusted monthly
- **Overall Impact**: Reduction in value of excess solar energy credits
- **Battery Pairing**: Incentivizes battery storage to maximize self-consumption

**No Net Metering**
- **States**: Alabama, South Dakota, Tennessee
- **Compensation**: Not mandated by state
- **Utility-Specific**: Some utilities may offer compensation voluntarily

**Utility-Specific Programs**
- **States**: Idaho, Texas
- **Structure**: Compensation through specific utility companies
- **Variation**: Different options by utility territory

**Key 2025 State Developments**

**Massachusetts**
- **System Size Increase**: Automatic eligibility increased from 10 kW to 25 kW AC
- **Effective**: Systems interconnected on/after February 2025
- **Benefit**: Room for fully electrified lifestyle without losing retail-rate net metering
- **Credit Rollover**: Credits roll forward to future bills; unused credits don't expire within year

**Nevada**
- **Action**: Nevada Power and Sierra Power filing net metering successor tariffs with regulators
- **Status**: Under regulatory review

**Idaho**
- **Action**: Rocky Mountain Power requesting approval for new export credit rate
- **System Size**: Requesting increase in maximum system size for non-residential from 100 kW to 2 GW
- **Status**: Pending approval

**Delaware**
- **Change**: Increased system size limit for farm customer-generators from 100 kW to 150 kW
- **Approved**: By Delaware Public Service Commission

**Washington**
- **Puget Sound Energy**: Already exceeded 100% of net metering obligation (as of June 2024)
- **Extension**: Allowing new solar to join current program until December 31, 2025, or until new rate structure implemented
- **Future**: Transitioning to new rate structure

**Maryland**
- **Community Solar**: Regulators approved rules for permanent community solar program
- **Net Metering**: Related to distributed solar policy

**Credit Expiration and Rollover Policies**

**Indefinite Rollover**
- **Common**: Many states allow credits to roll over month-to-month indefinitely
- **Benefit**: Credits never expire, can build up during high production months

**Annual Expiration**
- **Structure**: Unused credits expire at end of calendar or billing year
- **Impact**: "Use it or lose it" - encourages system sizing to match annual consumption
- **True-Up**: Annual reconciliation where excess credits may be paid out at lower rate or forfeited

**Retail Rate Credit**
- **Massachusetts Example**: When using more electricity than solar generates, charged standard rates for net energy used
- **Balance**: Net metering credits offset retail charges when production exceeds usage

**Federal Tax Credit Context (2025)**
- **CRITICAL**: Solar tax credit 2025 is final year for homeowners to claim 30% federal incentive
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025 for residential systems
- **Urgency**: Combined with net metering changes, creates urgency for homeowners to install solar

**Trends Away from Traditional Net Metering**

**California NEM 3.0**
- **Implemented**: Moved to net billing structure
- **Time-of-Use**: Hourly export credit changes
- **Battery Incentive**: Dramatically increased value of pairing solar with storage
- **Impact**: Overall reduction in solar value, but still economically viable with battery

**Other States Considering Revisions**
- **~1/3 of States**: Offer alternatives to traditional net metering
- **Additional Revisions**: States investigating "successors to their successors"
- **Trend**: Move toward time-varying compensation reflecting grid value

**Key Resources**
- **DSIRE Database**: Trusted resource for current state-specific policies
- **State PUC Websites**: Official net metering rules and tariffs
- **Utility Websites**: Specific programs and credit structures
