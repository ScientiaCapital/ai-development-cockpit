## Tips for Faster Team Creation

1. **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Tab to move between fields, Enter to save
2. **Keep this document open**: Split screen with Coperniq UI
3. **Copy names one at a time**: Don't try to multi-select from this doc
4. **Search works**: Type first few letters of name to find quickly
5. **Order doesn't matter**: Select members in any order
6. **Cross-assignment is expected**: Same person can be on multiple teams

---

- **Small teams** (8-10 members): 3-5 minutes
