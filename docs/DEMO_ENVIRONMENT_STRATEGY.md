# Company 63 - Demo Environment Strategy

**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Company**: Company 63 (Energy Hub) - Live Sales Demo Environment
**Purpose**: Invite prospects AS USERS to experience Coperniq from their persona perspective
**Status**: GAME-CHANGING SALES TOOL 🏆

---

## The Killer Discovery

**You can invite prospects AS USERS with specific roles** - they log in to Company 63 and experience Coperniq as if they actually work there!

### How This Destroys the Competition

**ServiceTitan**: Canned demos with fake data, prospects watch (don't interact)
**FieldEdge**: Sales presentations with screenshots, no hands-on
**Jobber**: Trial accounts that start empty, customer has to build everything
**BuildOps**: Demos are vendor-controlled, no self-service exploration

**Coperniq Company 63**: Prospect logs in AS A USER, clicks around, sees real workflows, experiences their day-in-the-life **without watching you present**

---

## The DUAL PURPOSE of Company 63

### Purpose 1: Internal Reference Implementation
- 150 employees demonstrating enterprise scale
- Complete BYOS documentation for customers to replicate
- Proves Coperniq handles $10M+ contractors

### Purpose 2: External Live Demo Environment
- **Invite prospects AS USERS** with role-based access
- They experience Coperniq from THEIR persona perspective
- They can click, explore, test workflows WITHOUT breaking anything
- It's personalized to THEIR role (Field Tech, PM, Sales Rep, Dispatcher, etc.)

---

## Role-Based Prospect Invitation Strategy

### ❌ NEVER Give Prospects Admin Role

**Why**: Admin = full company settings access, can delete data, change configurations, break the demo environment

**Admin role reserved for**: Internal team only (Tim, implementation partners, trusted advisors)

---

### ✅ Invite Prospects with These 3 Roles

#### **Manager Role** - For Management Prospects

**Who Gets This**:
- Project Manager prospects
- Operations Manager prospects
- Dispatch Coordinator prospects
- Service Manager prospects
- Controller/Accounting Manager prospects
- Regional Manager prospects

**What They Experience**:
- Full PM dashboard (active projects, budget tracking, milestone invoicing)
- Dispatch board (assign techs, manage schedule)
- Service plan management (renewals, MRR tracking)
- Invoice management (AR aging, collections)
- Team management (assign WOs, track capacity)

**Sales Pitch**: "Log in as a Manager and see how you'd manage your projects/team/dispatch from day one"

---

#### **Worker Role** - For Field Tech & CSR Prospects

**Who Gets This**:
- Field Technician prospects
- Installer prospects
- Customer Service Rep prospects
- Receptionist prospects

**What They Experience**:
- Mobile field tech view (my work orders today)
- Clock in/out, complete WOs, upload photos
- Fill inspection forms, asset surveys
- CSR call handling (create requests, schedule appointments)
- Customer lookup, portal access

**Sales Pitch**: "Log in on your phone as a Field Tech and see exactly what your techs would see every morning"

---

#### **Sales Role** - For Sales & Estimator Prospects

**Who Gets This**:
- Sales Representative prospects
- Estimator prospects
- Business Development Manager prospects
- Account Manager prospects

**What They Experience**:
- Lead pipeline (my leads, active proposals)
- Quote creation (with AI assistance)
- Follow-up queue (7/30/90 day reminders)
- Conversion tracking (won deals this month)
- Lead source performance

**Sales Pitch**: "Log in as a Sales Rep and see how you'd manage your pipeline and close more deals"

---

## The Sales Demo Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Before the Demo (Setup)

**Step 1: Qualify the Prospect**
- What's their role? (Field Tech, PM, Sales Rep, Dispatcher, Owner, etc.)
- What's their pain point? (scheduling chaos, lost invoices, no mobile app, etc.)
- What's their current software? (ServiceTitan, FieldEdge, pen & paper, Excel, etc.)

**Step 2: Create Demo User for Prospect**
1. Navigate to https://app.coperniq.io/63/company/members
2. Click "+ Add Member"
3. Fill in:
   - **Email**: prospect's email (e.g., john.smith@prospectcompany.com)
   - **First Name**: John
   - **Last Name**: Smith
   - **Role**: Manager, Worker, or Sales (based on their actual role)
   - **Phone**: Their phone number
   - **Status**: Active
4. Click "Save"
5. Coperniq sends invitation email to prospect

**Step 3: Personalize Their Experience**
- If they're a Field Tech → Assign them 3-5 demo work orders for "today"
- If they're a PM → Assign them 2-3 demo projects
- If they're a Sales Rep → Assign them 5-10 demo leads
- If they're a Dispatcher → Give them view access to all techs/WOs

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes to set up personalized demo

---

### During the Demo (Live Session)

**Step 1: Send Invitation Email**
- Prospect receives email: "You've been invited to Energy Hub (Company 63)"
- Email has login link + temporary password
- Prospect clicks link, sets their own password
- They're now logged into Coperniq AS A USER

**Step 2: Screen Share Call (30-45 minutes)**

**Opening** (5 min):
- "Go ahead and log in - you should see the Coperniq dashboard now"
- "You're logged in as a [Manager/Worker/Sales] - this is what YOUR team would see"
- "Feel free to click around, you can't break anything"

**Walkthrough** (20-30 min):
- Guide them through THEIR persona workflow:
  - **Field Tech**: "Click 'My Work Orders' - these are the jobs assigned to you today"
  - **PM**: "Click 'Active Projects' - see how you'd track your projects in real-time"
  - **Sales Rep**: "Click 'My Leads' - this is your follow-up queue"
  - **Dispatcher**: "Click 'Today's Schedule' - see all techs and all jobs on a map"

**Let Them Drive** (10-15 min):
- "What would YOU want to check right now if this was your real account?"
- "Go ahead, click around - show me what you'd look at first thing in the morning"
- "Try creating a work order / Try updating a project status / Try sending an invoice"

**Step 3: Show Them the Customer Portal (Bonus)**
- "Now let me show you what YOUR customers would see"
- Navigate to Customer Portal demo
- Show: View invoices, pay online, see scheduled appointments, request service

**Closing** (5 min):
- "Your login will stay active for 30 days - log in anytime, explore on your own"
- "Any questions? Want to see anything specific?"
- "Next step: We can set this up for YOUR company in 2-4 weeks with the BYOS program"

---

### After the Demo (Follow-Up)

**Step 1: Leave Their Account Active**
- Don't delete their user immediately
- Let them log in on their own time for 30 days
- They can show it to their team, test workflows, explore features

**Step 2: Email Follow-Up Template**

```

---

## The "No Admin" Rule Explained

### Why We NEVER Give Prospects Admin Role

**Admin can**:
- Delete all data (destroy the demo environment)
- Change company settings (break configurations)
- Delete other users (remove our demo employees)
- Access payment integrations (see Stripe/QuickBooks credentials)
- Change workflows (mess up our carefully configured processes)
- Archive forms, templates, automations
- Access API keys, webhooks, integrations

**One bad prospect** with Admin access = demo environment destroyed = hours of rebuild work

---

### What If Prospect Wants to See Company Settings?

**Option 1: Screen Share (You Drive)**
- "Let me show you company settings on screen share"
- You log in with Admin, they watch
- They can't click/break anything

**Option 2: Screenshots/Video**
- Record a Loom video walking through company settings
- Send them the video to watch on their own time
- No risk of them breaking anything

**Option 3: Build Them Their Own Sandbox (Qualified Prospect)**
- If they're serious (not just kicking tires), build them a separate sandbox
- Give them Admin on THEIR sandbox, not Company 63
- This is essentially a trial → paid conversion

---

## Security & Risk Management

### Data Privacy

**Real Customer Data**: NEVER use real customer data in Company 63
**Demo Data Only**: All 20 demo clients are fictional (from DEMO_ENVIRONMENT_PLAN.md)
**Prospect Data**: Prospect's email/phone is real (for login), but all activity data is demo/fictional

### Access Duration

**30-Day Auto-Expire**: Set prospect invitations to expire after 30 days
**Manual Deactivation**: After 30 days, manually deactivate their user account
**Reactivation**: If they come back interested, reactivate their account (don't create new user)

### Activity Monitoring

**Track Logins**: Monitor if prospects actually log in after the demo call
**Track Feature Usage**: See what features they clicked on (shows buying intent)
**Red Flags**: If prospect tries to delete data, export data, or access restricted areas → immediately deactivate

---

## Competitive Advantage vs. ServiceTitan

### ServiceTitan Demo Process

1. Schedule demo call with sales rep
2. Sales rep drives canned demo with fake data
3. Prospect watches (doesn't interact)
4. After demo, prospect has no access
5. If interested, pay $15K+ for implementation
6. THEN they get hands-on access

**Time to Hands-On**: 6-12 weeks + $15K-$30K

---

### Coperniq Company 63 Demo Process

1. Schedule demo call
2. **Prospect logs in AS A USER during the call**
3. **Prospect clicks around, explores, tests workflows**
4. **Prospect keeps access for 30 days after call**
5. **Prospect can show it to their team, test on phone, explore features**
6. If interested, BYOS program builds their instance in 2-4 weeks
7. No $15K implementation fee (DIY with our cookbook)

**Time to Hands-On**: 10 minutes (during first call)

---

## Sales Script for Introducing Company 63

### Opening Hook

"Before we start, I'm going to do something different than most software demos. Instead of ME showing YOU screenshots, I'm going to log YOU into a live Coperniq account AS A USER. You'll experience it exactly like YOUR [field techs/PMs/dispatchers/sales reps] would."

"It's called Company 63 - it's a $25-50M multi-trade contractor we built as a reference. You'll log in as a [Manager/Worker/Sales], click around, test workflows, see real data. Sound good?"

---

### Handling Objections

**Prospect**: "Is this a trial? Am I going to have to build everything myself?"
**You**: "Nope - this is already built. 150 employees, 20 customers, real workflows, real forms. You're walking into a fully operational system. If you like what you see, we can build THIS for YOUR company in 2-4 weeks using our BYOS program."

**Prospect**: "What if I break something?"
**You**: "You can't - you're logged in as a [Manager/Worker/Sales], not an Admin. Click around, explore, you're not going to delete anything. Worst case, we reset your demo data in 5 minutes."

**Prospect**: "How is this different from ServiceTitan's demo?"
**You**: "ServiceTitan shows you screenshots. I'm giving you the keys to a live system. Log in on your phone right now. See that? That's what your field techs would see. You can't do that with ServiceTitan until you pay $15K and wait 12 weeks."

---

## Metrics to Track

### Demo Conversion Metrics

- **Invitation Send Rate**: % of qualified prospects invited to Company 63
- **Login Rate**: % of invited prospects who actually log in
- **Feature Exploration**: Which features do prospects click on most?
- **Mobile App Download Rate**: % of Field Tech prospects who download mobile app
- **Demo-to-Paid Conversion**: % of prospects who convert after Company 63 demo
- **Time to Decision**: Days from demo to signed contract

### Hypothesis to Test

**H1**: Prospects who log in and click around themselves convert at 2-3x higher rate than prospects who only watch screen-share demos

**H2**: Field Tech prospects who download mobile app during demo call convert at 5x higher rate

**H3**: PM prospects who explore budget tracking features convert at higher ASP (they see value immediately)

---

## How Customers Build Their Own Version (BYOS + AI)

### The Complete Flow (Top of Funnel → Production)

#### **Step 1: Prospect Experiences Company 63** (30-45 min demo call)
- Logs in as user, clicks around, explores
- Sees 150 employees, 20 customers, real workflows
- Thinks: "I want THIS for MY company"

#### **Step 2: Prospect Says "How Do I Get This?"** (closing the deal)

**Your Answer**:
"Two options:

**Option A (DIY - $0 implementation)**:
We give you the complete BYOS Cookbook - step-by-step guide to replicate Company 63 for YOUR business. Takes 2-4 weeks, all self-service. You use Coperniq's AI to speed it up (like having an implementation consultant built-in).

**Option B (Guided - $X implementation)**:
We build it WITH you. Same cookbook, but we're on calls guiding you through each section. Takes 1-2 weeks. Hybrid approach - you own the knowledge, we speed you up."

#### **Step 3: Customer Follows BYOS Cookbook** (2-4 weeks DIY, 1-2 weeks guided)

**The cookbook documents ALL 24 Company Settings sections**:
1. General (company name, logo, timezone) - 15 min
2. Roles (use 4 defaults) - 5 min
3. Members (import your team) - 30 min to 3 hours depending on size
4. Teams (organize by trade/function) - 1 hour
5. Notifications (automation triggers) - 1 hour
6. Properties (custom fields) - 3 hours
7. **Process Studio** (THE CORE) - 20-30 hours:
   - Project Workflows (drag-and-drop phase configuration)
   - Request Workflows (lead pipelines, service calls)
   - Work Orders (field + office templates)
   - Forms (compliance checklists)
   - Payment Structures (revenue models)
   - Automations (70+ triggers/actions)
8. Advanced Config (labels, catalog, service plans, integrations) - 10-15 hours

**Total Time**:
- **Without AI**: 50+ hours (ServiceTitan charges $15K-$30K for this)
- **With AI**: 12-17 hours (Coperniq AI does the heavy lifting)

#### **Step 4: Customer Uses Coperniq AI at Every Step** (THIS IS THE MAGIC)

### The Time Savings Breakdown

| Task | Without AI | With AI | Time Saved | Speedup |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| 153 Work Orders | 50 hours | 5-8 hours | 42-45 hours | **10x** |
| 21 Forms | 10-15 hours | 1-2 hours | 8-13 hours | **15x** |
| 21 Workflows | 40-60 hours | 3-5 hours | 35-55 hours | **12x** |
| 70 Automations | 35-70 hours | 6-12 hours | 23-58 hours | **6x** |
| 11 Payment Structures | 8-11 hours | 1-2 hours | 6-9 hours | **8x** |
| **TOTAL** | **143-206 hours** | **16-29 hours** | **114-180 hours** | **9x avg** |

**Customer Saves**: 114-180 hours of manual configuration work
**Dollar Value**: 114-180 hours × $100/hr = **$11,400-$18,000 saved**

---

### The Sales Pitch (Closing Statement)

"Here's what makes this different from ServiceTitan or FieldEdge:

**ServiceTitan charges $15K-$30K for implementation**. They send a consultant to your office for 6-12 weeks. You sit in meetings. They build it. You watch.

**Coperniq gives you the blueprint (Company 63) + the cookbook (BYOS) + the AI assistant (✨ Ask AI)**.

You build it yourself in 2-4 weeks using Coperniq's AI. The AI does 90% of the work - you just review and approve. You save $15K-$30K. You own the knowledge. And when you need to add a new workflow or form next year? You don't call a consultant. You just ask the AI.

**Option A (DIY)**: $0 implementation, 2-4 weeks, all self-service with AI assistance
**Option B (Guided)**: $X implementation, 1-2 weeks, we guide you through the cookbook

Either way, you're saving $15K+ compared to ServiceTitan, and you're live in 1/4 the time."

---

### Customer Success Metrics

**Hypothesis to Test**:
- Customers who use AI for >50% of configuration tasks complete setup in 1-2 weeks (vs 4-6 weeks manual)
- Customers who use AI report 90%+ satisfaction with implementation (vs 60-70% with consultant-driven)
- Customers who build it themselves (with AI) have 2-3x higher feature adoption (they understand HOW it works)
- Customers who build it themselves churn at 50% lower rate (they're invested, not passive)
