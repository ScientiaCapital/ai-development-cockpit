## 5. Competitor Limitations

### Summary Matrix

| Competitor | Multi-Trade | Asset-Centric | Solar/Renewable | Service Plans | Integration Hell |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| ServiceTitan | Single-trade focus | Pricebook, not asset | None | Basic | 4-6 tools needed |
| Procore | Project-based only | None | None | None | Requires FSM |
| Housecall Pro | Limited | None | None | Weak | Multiple tools |
| FieldEdge | HVAC-centric | HVAC only | None | HVAC only | 3-4 tools |
| Jobber | Small teams | Basic | None | Basic | Limited scale |
| BuildOps | Complex config | Strong | None | Strong | Opaque pricing |
| ServiceMax | Salesforce-dependent | Excellent | Custom dev | Strong | Enterprise only |
| Salesforce FSL | CRM-first | Custom dev | Custom dev | Custom dev | Lock-in |

### Critical Gaps Across ALL Competitors

1. **No unified platform** - Every competitor forces 4-7 tool adoption
2. **No solar/renewable native** - Zero handle SREC, interconnection, OEM monitoring
3. **Asset architecture weak** - Only ServiceMax truly asset-centric
4. **Service plan automation** - Weak across all except enterprise
5. **Multi-trade** - Even ServiceTitan designed for siloed trades
6. **Implementation costs** - $10K-$100K+ for enterprise solutions
