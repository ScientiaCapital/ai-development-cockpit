## RMR Business Model Importance

Low Voltage contractors who implement RMR programs can:

1. **Offset labor costs** - Make price concessions on installation
2. **Increase company value** - Valuation multiples for recurring revenue
3. **Improve cash flow** - Predictable monthly income
4. **Customer retention** - Long-term contracts (36-60 months typical)
5. **Service differentiation** - Premium support offerings

### Typical RMR Margins

| Service Type | Dealer Cost | Customer Price | Gross Margin |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Basic Monitoring | $15/mo | $39.95/mo | 62% |
| Premium Monitoring | $22/mo | $59.95/mo | 63% |
| Video Verification | $45/mo | $125/mo | 64% |
| BMS Monitoring | $250/mo | $595/mo | 58% |
