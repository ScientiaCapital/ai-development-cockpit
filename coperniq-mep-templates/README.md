# MEP Template Package for YC SaaS Companies

**Product:** Pre-built MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) templates for field service SaaS platforms

**Target Customers:** YC-backed SaaS companies serving:
- HVAC contractors
- Plumbing companies
- Electrical contractors
- Fire protection services
- General MEP contractors

---

## The Problem

Every field service SaaS (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, Coperniq, etc.) needs MEP-specific:
- Inspection forms and checklists
- Work order templates
- Service agreement structures
- Equipment catalogs
- Price books

**Building these from scratch takes 6-12 months and deep industry knowledge.**

---

## Our Solution

We've already done the work:
- **15+ form templates** (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Fire Protection)
- **10+ work order templates** (service calls, PM visits, installs)
- **Service plan structures** (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- **Equipment catalogs** (manufacturer data, warranty info)
- **Price books** (labor rates, materials, markups)

**Plug-and-play for any field service platform.**

## Business Model

| Package | What's Included | Price |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Starter** | 50 templates, static files (JSON/PDF) | $2,500 |
| **Pro** | 100+ templates, database-ready (Supabase/Postgres) | $7,500 |
| **Enterprise** | Full integration + custom templates | $15,000+ |

**Margins:** 85-95% (digital product, no marginal cost)

---

## Why We're Different

1. **Built from real-world use** - Not theoretical, based on actual contractor workflows
2. **MEP vocabulary** - Uses industry terminology (not generic "field service")
3. **Integration-ready** - GraphQL/REST compatible, database schemas included
4. **Continuously updated** - Templates evolve with industry standards
