## Old vs New

**Old Description**:
> AI-Powered Development Cockpit: Advanced multi-LLM orchestration system with Task Master AI, Serena, and Shrimp integration for 100x developer productivity

**Problems with Old**:
- Mentions MCP servers we removed (Task Master AI, Serena, Shrimp)
- No mention of Cost Optimizer (our best feature!)
- No mention of authentication or Chinese LLM support
- Doesn't highlight production-ready status

**New Description**:
> Production-ready dual-domain LLM platform with revolutionary 90% cost savings. Complete auth, Chinese LLM support, 500K+ models. Built entirely on mobile with Claude Code! 🚀

**Why Better**:
- ✅ Removes outdated MCP references
- ✅ Highlights Cost Optimizer (90% savings)
- ✅ Mentions complete authentication
- ✅ Highlights Chinese LLM support
- ✅ Shows it's production-ready
- ✅ Celebrates the mobile achievement!
- ✅ More concise and punchy
