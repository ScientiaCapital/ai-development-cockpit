## TODO: Strategic Analysis Needed

### Questions to Answer:
1. What roles exist at Coperniq Energy?
2. What "CYA spreadsheets" are people maintaining outside Coperniq?
3. What daily/weekly decisions need dashboard support?
4. What metrics drive performance reviews?

#### Executive Level
- [ ] CEO/Owner Dashboard (company health, cash flow, growth)

#### Operations Management
- [ ] Operations Director Dashboard (resource utilization, capacity)
- [ ] Fleet Manager Dashboard (vehicle utilization, maintenance)

#### Project/Construction
- [ ] Project Manager Dashboard (active projects, deadlines, blockers)
- [ ] Construction Manager Dashboard (crew productivity, site status)

#### Sales/Business Development
- [ ] Sales Manager Dashboard (pipeline, conversion, rep performance)
- [ ] Individual Sales Rep Dashboard (my deals, my quota)

#### Service/O&M
- [ ] Service Manager Dashboard (ticket volume, SLA compliance)
- [ ] Dispatcher Dashboard (today's schedule, crew locations)

#### Back Office
- [ ] Permitting Coordinator Dashboard (permit status, AHJ tracking)
- [ ] Accounting Dashboard (unbilled work, collections aging)
