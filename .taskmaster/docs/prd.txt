# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Development Cockpit

## Overview
Build a comprehensive AI-powered development cockpit that orchestrates multiple AI systems (Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Local LLMs) with advanced task management (Task Master AI, Shrimp Task Manager, Serena) to create a 100x developer productivity environment.

## Goals
1. Create slash commands that orchestrate multiple MCP servers seamlessly
2. Integrate Task Master AI, Shrimp Task Manager, and Serena for comprehensive project management
3. Configure optimal model routing (Ollama DeepSeek/Qwen primary, Anthropic fallback)
4. Build learning acceleration system with knowledge persistence
5. Establish daily workflow automation for maximum productivity

## Core Features

### 1. Advanced Slash Commands System
- `/team-start-advanced` - Initialize all MCP servers with status check
- `/team-architect-mcp` - Architecture design using Serena + Sequential Thinking
- `/team-task-master` - Task Master AI workflow with research mode
- `/team-shrimp-plan` - Shrimp task planning and verification
- `/team-think-sequential` - Complex problem solving with step-by-step reasoning
- `/team-serena-analyze` - Deep code analysis and intelligence
- `/team-orchestrate` - Full MCP orchestration for complex features
- `/team-research` - Research mode with integrated planning
- `/project-init-mcp` - Initialize new projects with all MCPs
- `/daily-standup-mcp` - Comprehensive daily progress and planning

### 2. Task Management Integration
- Synchronize tasks between Task Master AI and Shrimp Task Manager
- Track implementation progress with verification scores
- Link code analysis from Serena to task requirements
- Persist context and learnings in Memory MCP
- Generate automated progress reports

### 3. Model Configuration & Routing
- Configure Task Master AI to use Ollama models as primary
- Set up DeepSeek Coder for code generation tasks
- Use Qwen 2.5 for research and analysis
- Anthropic Claude as fallback for complex reasoning
- Cost optimization with local-first strategy

### 4. Code Intelligence System
- Use Serena for codebase navigation and analysis
- Integrate code insights with task planning
- Automated code quality checks and suggestions
- Refactoring recommendations with impact analysis
- Documentation generation from code analysis

### 5. Learning Acceleration Framework
- Sequential thinking for complex problem breakdown
- Research mode integration with all planning systems
- Knowledge persistence across development sessions
- Automated learning extraction from completed tasks
- Progress metrics and skill development tracking

### 6. Development Workflow Automation
- Morning standup with all systems status
- Automated task prioritization and assignment
- Integrated testing and validation workflows
- End-of-day progress summarization
- Next-day preparation and context loading

## Technical Requirements

### MCP Server Integration
- Memory server for context persistence
- Sequential Thinking for complex reasoning
- Task Master AI with Ollama configuration
- Shrimp Task Manager for detailed planning
- Serena for code intelligence

### Model Configuration
- Primary: Ollama deepseek-coder:6.7b for code generation
- Research: Ollama qwen2.5:7b for analysis
- Fallback: Anthropic Claude for complex reasoning
- Local models for cost optimization
