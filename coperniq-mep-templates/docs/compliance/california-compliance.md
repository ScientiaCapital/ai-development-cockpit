- NEM 3.0: ~$0.05/kWh average export credit
- **Reduction**: 75% to 80% less compensation for exported solar energy

**Avoided Cost Calculator (ACC)**:
- NEM 3.0 uses ACC to determine utility savings from customer-generated solar power
- Credits based on time-of-use and grid demand, not retail rates

**Sources**:
- [Frequently Asked Questions About NEM 3.0 - Solar Rights Alliance](https://solarrights.org/blog/2024/10/01/faqnem3/)
- [What is NEM 3.0 and How Will it Impact California Solar Owners?](https://www.solar.com/learn/nem-3-0-proposal-and-impacts-for-california-homeowners/)

### 7.2 Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)

**CSLB Position (2025)**: Current regulations support California solar contractors holding a C-46 license to install solar panels **along with battery storage systems**.

**Licensing Discussion**: CSLB has been examining which licensed contractor is authorized to install BESS since 2016. Regulations continue to evolve.

**Importance for C-46 Contractors**: Understanding BESS installation, sizing, and integration is critical due to NEM 3.0's reduced export credits, making battery storage more economically attractive.

- **Single-family homes**: Must include solar PV system
- **Low-rise multifamily buildings**: Must include solar PV system

**Nonresidential & High-Rise Multifamily**:
- Required to integrate solar PV systems
- System sizing determined by one of two methods:

**Method 1: Solar Access Roof Area (SARA)**
- Based on available rooftop space
- Low-slope roofs: 14 W/ft²
- Steep-slope roofs: 18 W/ft²

**Method 2: Conditioned Floor Area (CFA)**
- Predetermined PV capacity factors per building type and climate zone

**Sizing Requirements**:
- Buildings required to have PV system by §140.10(a) must have BESS per §140.10(b)
- Minimum useable energy capacity determined by equations in Title 24 Part 6:
  - Equation 140.10-B (if CFA method used for PV sizing)
  - Equation 140.10-C (if SARA method used for PV sizing)
- Minimum power capacity determined by Equation 140.10-D
- Mixed occupancy buildings: Sum of minimum rated usable energy capacity for each required occupancy

**General Sizing Guideline**: Lesser of **5 kWh storage per 1 kW PV installed**, or building's expected peak demand

**Residential BESS**:
- Single-family homes that will not install BESS must meet **BESS-ready** requirements (infrastructure for future installation)
- Battery storage required in climate zones with higher reliability concerns or peak demand

**2025 Updates**:
- Updated BESS capacity factors
- Expanded rules for battery storage readiness
- Mandatory rapid shutdown devices for safety
