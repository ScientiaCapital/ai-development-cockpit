## Rural/Unincorporated Areas

### Regulatory Structure

**General rule**: Texas municipalities may only enforce requirements in:
1. Within city limits, OR
2. Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) of the municipality

**Unincorporated areas** (outside city limits):
- NO zoning regulations (county areas)
- County government handles permitting
- Limited building code enforcement

---

### When Permits ARE Required

**Building permits required for unincorporated areas when**:
1. New building construction for:
   - Commercial use
   - Public accessible use
   - Multi-family residential
2. Pre-built building located on property
3. Existing building undergoes "substantial improvement"

**Typical permits needed**:
- On-site sewer system permit (if no municipal sewer available)
- Septic system permit (often serves as "building permit" in Texas counties)
- Well permit (if no municipal water)
- Electrical permit (if required by county)

---

### The "No Permit" Myth

**Common misconception**: Building in unincorporated areas requires no permits
**Reality**:
- New home construction almost always requires permits
- Minor projects may not require permits
- Septic/sewer permits typically required

**Key question**: Does property have access to municipal services?
- If NO: On-site sewer/septic permit required
- If YES: Building permit may still be required

---

### Homestead Exemptions

**Tax benefit**: Reduces taxable value of primary residence, lowering tax bill

**Qualifications**:
- Home must be principal residence
- Ownership interest in property required
- Can include up to 20 acres of land (residential use)

**Land coverage**:
- Rural properties: Up to 20 acres
- Urban properties: Standard residential lot

**2025 legislative updates**:
- Municipal zoning regulations do NOT prohibit enforcement of:
  - Homeowners' association rules
  - Deed restrictions
  - Private agreements
- Effective: September 1, 2025 (Acts 2025)

---

### Filing for Homestead Exemption

**Central Appraisal Districts (CADs)**:
- Most: Online portals available
- Smaller/rural CADs: PDF or in-person filing only

**Filing options**:
1. Online through local CAD portal
2. Texas Comptroller Form 50-114: "Application for Residence Homestead Exemption"
3. Mail or in-person delivery to local CAD

---

### County-Specific Considerations

**Development regulations**:
- May apply in unincorporated areas
- Not zoning, but development standards
- Check with county planning department

**Rural permit enforcement**:
- Varies widely by county
- Some counties: Minimal enforcement
- Other counties: Active building departments

**Building code adoption**:
- Most rural counties: No adopted building codes
- Some counties: Adopt codes for commercial/multi-family only
- Always verify with county building official

---

### Best Practices for Rural Work

1. **Contact county building department** before starting work
2. **Verify septic/sewer requirements** (most common permit in rural areas)
3. **Check deed restrictions** (may be more restrictive than county requirements)
4. **Confirm electrical/plumbing permit requirements** (county-specific)
5. **Document all permits obtained** (important for property sale/financing)

---
