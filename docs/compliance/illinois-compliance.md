- All businesses with **one or more** (full-time or part-time) employees

#### Exemptions

#### Coverage for Contractors
- General contractors with ≥1 employee **must carry** workers' compensation
- Covers medical expenses and lost wages for job-related injuries/illnesses
- Owners of high-risk companies (contractors, truckers) automatically included on policies (but may elect to opt out, subject to extra-hazardous occupation rules)

#### Penalties for Non-Compliance
- **Fine**: Up to **$500 per day** of noncompliance
- **Minimum fine**: **$10,000**
- **Corporate officers** can be held personally liable if company fails to pay penalty

### 3. Bonding Requirements

#### State Level
- **Plumbing contractors**: No specific bond mentioned in statutes
- **Fire sprinkler contractors**: No specific bond mentioned (verify with OSFM)

#### Chicago
- Bond requirements vary by license type
- Check Chicago Department of Buildings for current bond amounts

#### Aurora Example

#### General Notes
- Illinois contractor bonds typically range **$10,000 to $100,000** (depending on license type)
- Bonds protect consumers, but provide **no business protection** (insurance needed for that)
- Check local regulations (each city has different bond requirements)
