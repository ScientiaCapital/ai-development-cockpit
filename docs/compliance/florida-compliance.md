## 7. Solar-Specific Requirements

### 7.1 Utility Interconnection Overview

**Regulatory Framework**: Florida Administrative Code Rule 25-6.065 (Public Service Commission)

**Major Utilities**:
- **FPL** (Florida Power & Light) - ~50% of state
- **Duke Energy Florida** - North/Central Florida
- **TECO** (Tampa Electric) - Tampa Bay area
- **FPUC** (Florida Public Utilities Corporation)
- Municipal utilities and co-ops

**Coverage**: ~79% of Florida residents served by IOUs with net metering

### 7.2 Net Metering Program

**How It Works**:
- When customer's solar system produces more electricity than consumed, excess sent to grid
- Customer receives **credit** at full retail rate
- Credits roll over monthly
- Unused credits at year-end (December meter read) purchased by utility at **wholesale rate** (typically 3-4 cents/kWh)

**System Size Limits**: Up to **2,000 kW** (2 MW) - exceeds most residential needs

**Eligible Technologies**:
- Solar photovoltaic
- Wind power
- Biomass
- Other renewable generating systems (per Florida Statutes 366.91(2), 366.92(2))

### 7.3 Interconnection Tiers

**Tier 1: ≤10 kW** (Typical Residential)
- **Application Fee**: NONE
- **Insurance**: NONE
- **Manual Disconnect**: NOT required (Duke); may be required (FPL - check standards)
- **Processing**: Streamlined permitting and inspection
- **Reimbursement**: Single-phase disconnect switch up to $320 (TECO)

**Tier 2: >10 kW to 100 kW** (Large Residential, Small Commercial)
- **Application Fee**:
  - FPL: $400
  - Duke: $240
  - TECO: $250
- **Insurance**:
  - $1,000,000 general liability (all utilities)
  - Proof of insurance renewal required **annually**
- **Manual Disconnect**: REQUIRED

- **Application Fee**: $750+ (varies by utility)
- **Insurance**: $2,000,000 general liability
- **Manual Disconnect**: REQUIRED (same specs as Tier 2)
- **Service**: Often requires 3-phase service (WYE) for systems ≥50 kW
- **Additional Requirements**: May require utility transformer upgrades, advanced interconnection studies

### 7.4 FPL Interconnection Requirements

**Technical Standards**:
- **NEC Compliance**: Article 690 - Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems
- **Interconnections**: NOT permitted with utility transformer or in meter can
- **Generation Limit**: Limited to **90% of FPL service capacity**

4. For Tier 2/3: Provide proof of insurance and pay application fee
5. Install system per NEC and FBC
6. Pass local building inspection
7. FPL inspection (24-hour meter access required)
8. FPL replaces meter with bi-directional meter
9. Sign interconnection agreement (Permission to Operate)

**Net Metering Credits**:
- Excess energy (less than supplied by FPL) subtracted from monthly usage before billing
- If produce more than receive, excess rolls to next month
- Unused kWh bank in December: credit applied to December bill

### 7.5 Duke Energy Florida Interconnection

**Tier 1 (≤10 kW)**:
- **Application Fee**: NONE
- **Insurance**: NONE

### 7.7 Hurricane Tie-Down and Mounting Requirements

**Florida Building Code 8th Edition (2023)**:
- Rooftop PV systems designed per Section **R905.17**
- Wind loads per **ASCE 7**

**Wind Speed Requirements**:
- **Most of Florida**: Minimum **160 mph** wind resistance
- **Wind Pressure**: 3,300 Pa (typical)
- **Building-Specific Variables**: Height, distance from water, roof layout, exposure category

**Exposure Categories** (wind design):
- **Exposure B**: Urban/suburban (closely spaced buildings)
- **Exposure C**: Open terrain (scattered obstructions)
- **Exposure D**: Flat unobstructed areas over open water (≥1 mile)
- **HVHZ**: Minimum Exposure C required (~40% increase in design loads for 30' tall structure)

**Panel Wind Uplift Ratings**:
- Typical rated wind uplift: **4,000 Pa** (83.5 psf)
- Required safety factor: **1.5**
- Allowable uplift: **2,667 Pa** (55.7 psf)

**Attachment and Tie-Down Best Practices**:
- **Roof Attachment**: Attach to **rafters** (not decking) on composition shingle roofs
- **Lag Bolts**: Use L-bracket with space for **2 lag bolts** (not 1) for each attachment
- **Rail Configuration**: Use **3 rails per panel row** (instead of 2) in hurricane zones
- **Roof Zones**:
  - Highest uplift at roof edges and corners
  - Avoid placing arrays in critical edge zones if possible
  - If unavoidable, **reduce attachment spacing** to compensate
- **Edge Zone**: Any panel within **half the building height** from roof edge requires higher factors
- **Attachment Density**: Reduce anchor spacing to distribute load and lower per-anchor pullout force
- **Lag Bolt Depth**: Increase depth into rafter to increase withdrawal capacity

**High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ)**:
- **Miami-Dade & Broward Counties**: Strictest requirements
- **Mounting Systems**: Must be tested and approved for HVHZ
- **Product Approval**: Miami-Dade NOA (Notice of Acceptance) - first approvals for solar racking (e.g., Unirac SOLARMOUNT)

**Structural Design Considerations**:
- Spacing of tie-down straps/attachment points based on wind uplift for specific location
- Proper number of attachments to resist wind forces
- Roof edge areas subject to higher wind speeds and turbulence
- Corners experience highest wind loads

### 7.8 Florida Solar Access Law (Florida Solar Rights Act)

**Legal Authority**: Florida Statute **163.04**

**Core Protection**: Property owner **MAY NOT BE DENIED** permission to install solar collectors or energy devices by:
- Deed restrictions
- Covenants
- Declarations
- HOA/COA binding agreements
- Any entity with power to approve, forbid, control, or direct property alterations

**Orientation Requirements**:
- South-facing OR within **45° east or west of due south**
- Entity (HOA) may determine specific roof location IF determination does not impair effective operation

**What HOAs CAN Do**:
- Require architectural review process (prior approval)
- Request diagrams, dimensions, layout illustrations
- Review wiring and electrical components
- Approve panel height from roof
- Determine specific rooftop location (within 45° of south)

**What HOAs CANNOT Do**:
- **Outright denial** of solar installations
- Require screening from view (by trees, fences, ground mounting)
- Limit installation to area not visible from street (if impairs efficiency)
- Require panels to conform to certain color (e.g., match roof color)
- Impose requirements that:
  - Restrict system operating efficiency
  - Increase system installation cost
  - Impair system operation

**Condominiums**:
- Solar rights limited to "**within the boundaries of a condominium unit**"
- Roof typically **outside** unit boundaries - statute may not apply
- **HB 697**: Allows condo boards to install solar on properties to benefit unit owners without prior approval
- Allows unit owners to install solar within their own condos

**Best Practice**: Seek HOA/COA approval PRIOR to installation (legal protection does not waive approval requirement if mandated by governing documents)

### 7.9 Florida Energy Code - Solar-Ready Provisions

**Appendix RB**: Solar-Ready Provisions for Detached One- and Two-Family Dwellings, Townhouses

**Collector Installation Requirements**:
- **Tilt Angle**: Between **10° and 40°** from horizontal
- **Orientation**: Within **45° of true south**

**Scope**: Applies to new residential construction (when Appendix RB adopted by jurisdiction)
