# Coperniq MEP Templates

> **64 production-ready form templates** for MEP contractors.
> Built as Sr. BDR at Coperniq to understand the product deeply and serve customers better.

---

## What It Does

- **64 YAML form templates** across 14 trade categories (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Solar, Fire Protection)
- **GTM vertical configs** with exact Coperniq GraphQL type alignment
- **Service plan templates** for recurring revenue structures
- **Work order templates** for service calls, PM visits, installations

## Why I Built This

As Sr. BDR at Coperniq, I needed to deeply understand our product and the contractors we serve. Building these templates gave me:
- Hands-on experience with Coperniq's data model (4,037 GraphQL types)
- Deep understanding of MEP contractor workflows and pain points
- Technical credibility when talking to prospects
- Ability to demo real industry templates instead of generic examples

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ai-development-cockpit
ls templates/           # Browse by trade (hvac/, plumbing/, electrical/, etc.)
cat TEMPLATE_INVENTORY.md
```
