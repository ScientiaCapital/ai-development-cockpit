## 💡 Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Forms = Killer Feature (30x Faster!)
**Before**: 30-45 minutes to manually build inspection form
**After**: 10 seconds with AI prompt
**Example**: "Commercial Building Monthly PM Inspection - HVAC" form
- 7 logical sections
- 20+ fields with intelligent types
- Pass/Fail checklists
- Temperature readings
- Signature capture
- Mobile-optimized

**Impact**: Contractors can create unlimited trade-specific forms instantly

---

### Discovery 2: Work Orders Auto-Generate from Projects
**Pattern**: AI-create Project → Select workflow → Work orders auto-generated

**Example**:
```
Project: HVAC Commercial Install
Workflow: "HVAC Commercial Install"
Auto-generated WOs:
  - Site Survey
  - Permitting
  - Equipment Procurement
  - Installation
  - Commissioning
  - Customer Handoff
```

**Impact**: 1 AI prompt = Project + 6 work orders (saves 1+ hour per project)

---

### Discovery 3: AI Expands Brief Notes into Professional Documents
**Input**: "Replaced compressor cap. $2,400."

**AI Output**:
"Comprehensive replacement of the failed compressor capacitor on a 10-year-old Carrier 4-ton air conditioning unit. The service included removal of the defective capacitor, installation of a new compatible capacitor, necessary refrigerant recharge, and system testing to ensure optimal performance and reliability."

**Impact**: Field tech shorthand → Customer-facing professional language

---

### Discovery 4: Natural Language = Database Structure
**Conversational Prompt**:
```
Trane 3-ton AC unit, 15 years old, installed 2010.
Serial: A12345678. R-410A refrigerant. Phoenix, AZ.
```

**AI Extracts**:
- Type: Air Conditioner
- Manufacturer: Trane
- Size: 3 tons
- Serial: A12345678
- Installation Date: 01/01/2010 (calculated from "2010")
- Age: 15 years (calculated from "15 years old")
- Refrigerant: R-410A
- Location: Phoenix, AZ

**Impact**: No training required - speak naturally, AI structures data
