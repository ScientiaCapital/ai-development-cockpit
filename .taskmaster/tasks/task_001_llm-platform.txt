# Task ID: 1
# Title: Model Marketplace Interface Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the core foundation for a terminal-based model marketplace interface that integrates SwaggyStacks and ScientiaCapital HuggingFace organizations, featuring dual theme support and advanced model discovery capabilities.
# Details:
Implementation approach and technical considerations:

1. Terminal Interface Framework:
- Utilize Python's Rich library for advanced terminal UI components
- Implement Textual framework for TUI (Text User Interface) layout management
- Create base AbstractTheme class to support swappable themes

2. Core Components:
- ModelRegistry class to handle model metadata and organization integration
- SearchEngine class implementing Elasticsearch-like functionality
- FilterManager for advanced filtering capabilities
- ThemeManager supporting gaming and corporate aesthetics

3. Data Structure:
```python
class ModelMetadata:
    id: str
    name: str
    organization: str
    tags: List[str]
    performance_metrics: Dict
    deployment_config: DeploymentConfig

class MarketplaceInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = ModelRegistry()
        self.theme_manager = ThemeManager()
        self.search_engine = SearchEngine()
        self.filter_manager = FilterManager()
```

4. API Integration:
- Implement HuggingFace Hub API client for both organizations
- Create unified model metadata schema
- Implement caching layer for performance optimization

5. Theme Implementation:
- Gaming theme: neon colors, ASCII art borders, animated loading
- Corporate theme: muted colors, clean lines, professional formatting
- Theme switching mechanism with hot-reload capability

6. Search & Filter Implementation:
- Fuzzy search using rapidfuzz library
- Advanced filtering with MongoDB-style query syntax
- Real-time search results updates
- Search history and favorites support

7. Error Handling:
- Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Add retry mechanisms for network operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages

8. Performance Considerations:
- Implement pagination for large model lists
- Use background threading for API calls
- Optimize search index updates

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
- Test each core component in isolation
- Verify theme switching functionality
- Validate search and filter operations
- Test API integration with mock responses

2. Integration Testing:
```python
def test_marketplace_integration():
    marketplace = MarketplaceInterface()
    # Test organization integration
    assert len(marketplace.registry.get_organizations()) == 2
    # Test search functionality
    results = marketplace.search_engine.search("bert")
    assert len(results) > 0
    # Test theme switching
    marketplace.theme_manager.switch_theme("gaming")
    assert marketplace.theme_manager.current_theme.name == "gaming"
```

3. Performance Testing:
- Measure response times for search operations
- Verify pagination performance with large datasets
- Test memory usage under heavy load
- Benchmark API integration performance

4. User Experience Testing:
- Verify all keyboard shortcuts work
- Test navigation flows
- Confirm theme rendering in different terminal sizes
- Validate error message clarity

5. Acceptance Criteria:
- Successfully load models from both organizations
- Search response time under 500ms
- Smooth theme transitions
- Correct filter application
- Proper error handling display
