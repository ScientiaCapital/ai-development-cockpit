| 35%+ | $4,000 (moderate income: $8,000) |

#### Measured Pathway

**How It Works**:
- Pay-for-performance based on **actual** energy savings
- Uses DOE-approved open-source measurement & verification (M&V)
- Based on pre- and post-upgrade utility bill data

**Requirements**:
- Minimum **15% measured energy savings**
- Can be calculated for single home or portfolio of homes
- Post-installation utility data verification

**Rebate Calculator**: DOE provides online calculator for measured path incentive payments

### State Allocation Formula

Funds distributed using State Energy Program allocation formula in effect January 1, 2022.

**Example State Allocations**:
- Texas: $690 million
- Tennessee: $83.7 million
- California, New York, Florida: Higher allocations (proportional to population)

### Energy Assessment Requirements

## 7. Incentive Stacking Rules

### Can You Combine Incentives?

Understanding stacking rules is critical to maximizing customer savings.

### 25C + 25D (Same Year)

**✅ YES - Can Stack**
- 25C and 25D are **separate programs**
- Can claim both in the same tax year
- Example:
  - 25C: $2,000 heat pump credit
  - 25D: $9,000 solar + battery credit (30% of $30k system)
  - **Total**: $11,000 in tax credits

**Optimal Strategy**:
- Use **25C** for efficiency upgrades (heat pump, insulation, windows, electrical panel)
- Use **25D** for renewable energy (solar, battery storage)
- Claim both on same year's tax return (Form 5695)

---

### 25C + HEEHR

**⚠️ PARTIAL STACKING**
- HEEHR rebate applied **first** (at point of sale)
- 25C credit calculated on **net cost after rebate**

**Example**:
- Heat pump total cost: $10,000
- HEEHR rebate (low-income): -$8,000
- Net cost to customer: $2,000
- 25C credit: 30% of $2,000 = **$600**
- **Total savings**: $8,600 (86% of project)

**Why This Works**:
- HEEHR is a **rebate** (purchase price adjustment)
- 25C calculated on actual amount paid
- IRS treats rebates differently than non-rebate incentives

---

### 25D + HEEHR

**⚠️ PARTIAL STACKING**
- Same rules as 25C + HEEHR
- Subtract HEEHR rebate from basis before calculating 25D credit

**Example**:
- Solar + battery system: $30,000
- HEEHR battery rebate (if applicable to storage): -$0 (typically not covered by HEEHR)
- Net cost: $30,000
- 25D credit: 30% of $30,000 = **$9,000**

**Note**: HEEHR primarily covers electrification equipment (heat pumps, panels, wiring), not solar. Most customers will use full 25D credit for renewable systems.

---

### HOMES vs. HEEHR

**❌ NO - Cannot Use Both for Same Upgrade**
- Must choose **one program** per upgrade
- Cannot double-dip on same equipment

**Decision Matrix**:

| Customer Profile | Best Choice | Reason |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| Income <80% AMI | **HEEHR** | 100% coverage up to $14k |
| Income 80-150% AMI | **HEEHR** or **HOMES** | Compare rebate amounts |
| Income >150% AMI | **HOMES** | Not eligible for HEEHR |
| Deep retrofit (35%+ savings) | **HOMES** | Higher rebate for whole-home approach |
| Simple electrification (heat pump only) | **HEEHR** | Point-of-sale discount |

**Can Combine HOMES/HEEHR Across Projects**:
- Use HEEHR for heat pump in Year 1
- Use HOMES for whole-home retrofit in Year 2
- Just not for the **same equipment** in the **same project**

---

### Utility Rebates + 25C/25D

**⚠️ MUST SUBTRACT FROM BASIS**
- Utility incentives and rebates are **purchase price adjustments**
- Subtract from qualified expenses **before** calculating 25C/25D credit

**Example**:
- Heat pump total cost: $8,000
- Utility rebate: -$1,000
- Net qualified expense: $7,000
- 25C credit: 30% of $7,000 = **$2,000** (capped at $2,000 for heat pumps)

**Rule**: Regardless of program administrator, rebates reduce the tax credit basis.

---

### Non-Rebate Incentives + 25C/25D

**✅ DO NOT REDUCE BASIS**
- State tax credits (not rebates)
- Local incentives (not rebates)
- Property tax exemptions
- Other non-rebate incentives

**These do NOT impact 25C/25D credit calculation.**

---

### Stacking Summary Table

| Incentive Combination | Allowed? | Notes |
|-----------------------|----------|-------|
| 25C + 25D | ✅ Yes | Separate programs, claim both same year |
| 25C + HEEHR | ⚠️ Partial | Subtract HEEHR from basis, then calculate 25C |
| 25D + HEEHR | ⚠️ Partial | Subtract HEEHR from basis, then calculate 25D |
| HOMES + HEEHR (same upgrade) | ❌ No | Choose one per project |
| HOMES + HEEHR (different projects) | ✅ Yes | Different equipment, different timelines |
| Utility Rebate + 25C/25D | ⚠️ Partial | Subtract rebate from basis |
| Non-rebate incentive + 25C/25D | ✅ Yes | Does not reduce credit basis |
| 179D + 25C/25D | N/A | Commercial vs. residential (different properties) |
| 45L + 48E | N/A | Different property types |

---

### Maximizing Customer Savings: Example Scenario

**Customer Profile**: Low-income homeowner (<80% AMI), $40,000 household income

**Project**: Whole-home electrification
- Heat pump: $10,000
- Heat pump water heater: $2,500
- Electrical panel upgrade: $3,000
- Insulation/air sealing: $4,000
- **Total**: $19,500

**Optimal Stacking Strategy**:

1. **HEEHR Rebate** (applied first):
   - Heat pump: $8,000
   - HPWH: $1,750
   - Panel: $3,000 (capped at $4,000 HEEHR limit, but $3k actual cost)
   - Total HEEHR: $12,750

2. **Net Cost After HEEHR**: $6,750

3. **25C Tax Credit** (on remaining cost):
   - Heat pump: $2,000 credit (on $2,000 net cost)
   - HPWH: $0 credit (fully covered by HEEHR)
   - Panel: $0 credit (fully covered by HEEHR)
   - Insulation: $1,200 credit (on $4,000 cost)
   - Total 25C: $3,200

4. **Total Savings**: $15,950 out of $19,500 (**82% covered**)
5. **Customer Pays**: $3,550 (18% of project)

**Key Insight**: Combining HEEHR + 25C for low-income customers can cover 80-90% of electrification projects.
