## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive compliance requirements for solar contractors operating in states with active Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) programs. As of 2024-2025, seven states maintain active SREC markets with varying program structures, pricing mechanisms, and contractor requirements.

### SREC Market Overview

**How SRECs Work:**
- 1 SREC = 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) = 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of solar electricity generated
- SRECs are sold separately from electricity production
- Market prices determined by supply/demand, capped by Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP)
- Utilities purchase SRECs to meet Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) solar carve-out requirements

**Active SREC States (as of 2024-2025):**
1. New Jersey - SREC-II Program (fixed $85/SREC residential, $110/SREC commercial)
2. Maryland - Brighter Tomorrow Act ($70/SREC certified, $48/SREC standard)
3. Massachusetts - Transitioned to SMART Program (production-based, $0/kWh currently for solar-only)
4. Washington DC - Premium market ($425-$480/SREC)
5. Pennsylvania - Alternative Energy Credit market ($31-$35/SREC)
6. Ohio - Declining market ($3-$9/SREC, program ending 2026)

- **Cross-Roof Pathways:** At least every 150 feet
- **Array Dimensions:** No single axis >150 feet
- **Ridge Clearance:** Panels ≤3 feet below ridge (IFC 605.11.3.2.4)

**Purpose:**

- Fire spread prevention to adjacent buildings

### Typical Setback Ranges

- **Standard Setback:** 18-36 inches from roof components
- **Pathway Width:** Minimum 36 inches (914 mm) eave to ridge

## APPENDIX C: SREC Price Comparison (2024-2025)

### Current Market Values by State

| State | SREC Price Range | SACP (Cap) | Contract Type | Program Status |
|-------|-----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Washington DC** | $400-$480 | $480 (2024) | Spot/Forward | Active - Highest Value |
| **New Jersey** | $85 (fixed) | $208 (2025) | 15-year fixed | Active - SREC-II |
| **Maryland** | $48-$73.50 | $55 (2025) | Spot market | Active - Brighter Tomorrow |
| **Pennsylvania** | $25-$35 | $66.40 | 3-year lifespan | Active - AEPS/SAEC |
| **Delaware** | $30-$32 | N/A | 20-year contract | Active - Auction |
| **Massachusetts** | $0/kWh (solar-only) | N/A | SMART production | Transitioned from SREC |
| **Ohio** | $3-$9 | $50 (2024) | 5-year lifespan | **REPEALED - Ends 2028** |

### Annual Earnings Potential Examples

**8 kW Residential System (10 MWh/year = 10 SRECs/year):**

- **Washington DC:** 10 SRECs × $440 = **$4,400/year** ($22,000 over 5 years)
- **New Jersey:** 10 SRECs × $85 = **$850/year** ($12,750 over 15 years)
- **Maryland (Certified):** 10 SRECs × $70 = **$700/year** ($3,500 over 5 years)
- **Maryland (Standard):** 10 SRECs × $48 = **$480/year** ($2,400 over 5 years)
- **Pennsylvania:** 10 SRECs × $31 = **$310/year** ($930 over 3 years)
- **Delaware:** 9 SRECs × $30 = **$270/year** ($5,400 over 20 years)
- **Massachusetts:** Production incentive varies (currently $0 for solar-only)
- **Ohio:** 10 SRECs × $5 = **$50/year** (program ending 2028)

### Market Dynamics

**High-Value Markets (Tight Supply):**
- Washington DC: Geographic limitation (city-only systems), high RPS targets
- New Jersey: Fixed-rate SREC-II provides price certainty

**Mid-Value Markets (Balanced):**
- Maryland: Brighter Tomorrow Act created premium tier
- Pennsylvania: Moderate AEPS requirements

**Low-Value Markets (Oversupplied):**
- Ohio: Oversubscribed market, program repealed
- Massachusetts: Transitioned away from SREC to SMART production incentives

### Investment Payback Considerations

When evaluating SREC states for solar investment:
1. **Total SREC Value:** Calculate over full contract/lifespan
2. **Price Certainty:** Fixed (NJ) vs market-based (MD, PA)
3. **Program Longevity:** 15-20 year contracts vs 3-5 year lifespans
4. **Market Risk:** Spot market volatility vs locked-in rates
5. **Additional Incentives:** Federal ITC (30%), state rebates, utility programs
