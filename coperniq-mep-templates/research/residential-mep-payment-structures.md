- Long-term contract (early termination fees)
- Transfer to new homeowner requires credit approval

### PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) Rates

**How It Works**:
- Third-party owns system

- Debt transfers with property sale
- Can cover solar + energy efficiency upgrades

**Drawbacks**:
- Creates a tax lien on property (priority lien in some states)
- Can complicate mortgage refinancing
- Not available in all states/municipalities
- Some mortgage lenders prohibit PACE financing

**Typical Terms**:
- 15-25 year repayment
- 5-9% interest rates (varies by program)
- Minimum project size: $5,000-$10,000

### Tax Credit Timing (CRITICAL for 2025)

**Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**:
- **30% tax credit** for residential solar installed by **12/31/2025**
- Expires for residential after 2025
- Commercial ITC continues (Section 48) for systems that:
  - Begin construction before July 2026 OR
  - Are placed in service before January 2028

**Impact on Financing**:
- **Cash/Loan**: Homeowner claims 30% tax credit (up to $9,000 on $30,000 system)
- **Lease/PPA**: Third-party owner claims commercial tax credit (homeowner gets nothing)
- **Urgency**: Limited installer capacity through 2025 year-end

**Other Incentives**:
- State rebates: Varies by state
- Utility rebates: Varies by utility
- SREC (Solar Renewable Energy Credits): Varies by state
- Net metering credits: Varies by utility

## 5. Emergency/Urgent Work Payment Structures

### COD (Cash on Delivery) Requirements

**When COD is Required**:
- Emergency after-hours service calls
- First-time customers (no relationship)
- Small urgent repairs (under $500)
- Situations where contractor doesn't trust payment

**Payment Methods for COD**:
- Cash (with receipt)
- Check (risky for contractor - may bounce)
- Credit card (most common - immediate authorization)
- Debit card

**Industry Practice**:
- Not universal - varies by contractor
- National companies less likely to require COD
- Small local contractors more likely to require COD
- Established customers rarely required to pay COD

### Premium Pricing Structures

**Emergency Service Call Fees**:
- **Standard Service Call**: $75 - $200
- **Emergency Service Call**: $150 - $400 (2x - 3x standard rate)
- Often waived/credited toward repair if work approved same visit

**After-Hours Labor Rates**:
- **Standard Hourly**: $75 - $150/hour
- **Emergency/After-Hours**: $150 - $250/hour (1.5x - 2x standard)
- **Weekend/Holiday Premium**: Additional $100+ surcharge

**Example Pricing**:
- **Weekday Repair**: $200 service call + $100/hr labor = $300 total (1 hour job)
- **Sunday Evening**: $300 service call + $200/hr labor = $500 total (same 1 hour job)

**What Triggers Premium Pricing**:
- After-hours (nights, weekends, holidays)
- Same-day/emergency response
- Immediate service required (system down, no heat/AC)
- Short-notice scheduling (within 2-4 hours)

### After-Hours Rate Cards

**Typical Rate Card Structure**:

- **After-Hours** (Mon-Fri, 5pm-10pm): 1.5x rates
- **Late Night** (10pm-6am): 2x rates
- **Weekends** (Sat-Sun): 1.5x rates
- **Holidays**: 2-3x rates

**Service Call Fee Examples**:

- Emergency: $200-$300

**Hourly Labor Examples**:
- Regular: $100/hr
- After-hours: $150/hr
- Emergency: $200-$250/hr

### Contractor Philosophy on Emergency Pricing

**Premium Pricing Advocates**:
- "They called you, they agreed to your price, charge them"
- Compensates for disruption to contractor's personal time
- National companies often charge premium (judged on effectiveness, not price)

**Standard Pricing Advocates**:
- Don't charge extra for emergencies (builds reputation/referrals)
- Trip charge + 30 minutes included, then standard hourly rate
- Waive emergency fee for existing good clients (note on invoice as courtesy)

**Middle Ground**:
- Premium pricing for new/unknown customers
- Standard pricing for established customers
- Transparency about pricing before dispatch

## 6. Rebate/Incentive Integration

### How Utilities are Applied to Invoices

**Point-of-Sale Rebates** (Instant Rebates):
- **Colorado HEAR Program**: Launched Nov 2025, point-of-sale rebates through registered contractors
- **SoCalGas Instant Rebate Marketplace**: Rebate already deducted from product price
- **TECH Clean California**: Incentives + HEEHRA rebates via trained contractors

**How It Works**:
1. Customer selects equipment from contractor
2. Contractor verifies rebate eligibility (energy efficiency ratings, model numbers)
3. Rebate amount deducted at checkout
4. Customer pays net amount (post-rebate)
5. Contractor submits rebate claim to utility/program
6. Contractor reimbursed by utility (3-8 weeks typical)

**Contractor Requirements**:
- Register with rebate program
- Complete required training (TECH Clean California)
- Submit documentation (invoices, equipment specs, installation photos)
- Wait for reimbursement (cash flow impact)

**Customer Benefits**:
- Immediate savings (no waiting for rebate check)
- Lower upfront cost
- Simplified process (contractor handles paperwork)

### Post-Purchase Rebates (Traditional)

**How It Works**:
1. Customer pays full amount to contractor
2. Customer receives invoice/proof of purchase
3. Customer submits rebate claim to utility/program
4. Customer receives rebate check (4-12 weeks)

**Contractor Involvement**:
- Provide documentation (invoices, equipment model numbers)
- Educate customer on rebate eligibility
- May assist with rebate application

### Point-of-Sale Rebate Handling

**Invoice Treatment**:
- **Line Item Deduction**: Show full price, then rebate as negative line item
  - Example: HVAC System: $10,000
  - Utility Rebate: -$1,500
  - **Net Amount Due: $8,500**

**Contractor Cash Flow**:
- Contractor floats $1,500 until utility reimburses
- Requires working capital
- Reimbursement timeline: 3-12 weeks typical

**Software Integration**:
- ServiceTitan, FieldEdge, BuildOps support rebate tracking
- Automated rebate application submission
- Tracking of pending reimbursements

### Tax Credit Documentation

**Federal Tax Credits (Expires 12/31/2025)**:

**Heat Pumps (HVAC + Water Heating)**:
- **Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C)**: Up to 30% of costs, $2,000 annual limit
- **Combined Limit**: HVAC heat pump + water heater heat pump share $2,000 limit
- **Panel Upgrades**: Up to 30% of costs, $600 cap (if needed for heat pump installation)

**Solar (Residential ITC)**:

- **Invoice with**:
  - Equipment make/model/serial numbers
  - Installation date
  - Total cost breakdown (equipment + labor)
  - Contractor license number
  - Property address
- **Installation Photos** (some programs)

**Customer Responsibility**:
- File IRS Form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits) with tax return

2. **State Rebate**: Varies ($500-$5,000 typical)
3. **Utility Rebate**: Varies ($250-$2,000 typical)
4. **Manufacturer Rebate**: Seasonal (Carrier Cool Cash: $250-$650)
5. **Dealer Discount**: Negotiable

**Example Stack (High-Efficiency Heat Pump)**:
- **System Cost**: $12,000
- **Dealer Discount**: -$500 (sale pricing)
- **Utility Rebate**: -$1,200 (instant, point-of-sale)
- **Net Amount Paid**: $10,300
- **Federal Tax Credit** (30% of $12,000): -$3,600 (claimed on taxes)

**Contractor Role in Stacking**:
- Proposal builder tools (Trane, Carrier) calculate all available incentives
- Customer education on timing (rebates vs. tax credits)
- Documentation for all programs

**Timing Considerations**:
- Point-of-sale rebates: Applied at time of sale
- Manufacturer rebates: Submit within 30-90 days of installation
- Tax credits: Claimed when filing taxes (April following year)
- State/utility rebates: Submit within 30-180 days (varies by program)

### Rebate Administration Burden

**Contractor Responsibilities**:
- Stay current on rebate program changes (programs update frequently)
- Train sales team on available incentives
- Complete required certifications (TECH Clean, ENERGY STAR partner)
- Submit complete applications (incomplete = delays)
- Track pending reimbursements (accounts receivable from utilities)
- Follow up on delayed reimbursements

**Software Solutions**:
- ServiceTitan: Rebate tracking, proposal builder with incentives
- FieldEdge: HVAC-specific rebate tools
- BuildOps: Commercial MEP rebate tracking

**Cash Flow Impact**:
- Point-of-sale rebates require contractor to float funds (3-12 weeks)
- Large volume contractors may have $50,000-$200,000 in pending rebates
- Some contractors avoid point-of-sale programs due to cash flow strain
