## 1. Procurement Process

### 1.1 RFP (Request for Proposal)

**When Used**: Complex projects where technical approach matters as much as price
- Evaluation based on "best value" (technical merit + price)
- Contractors submit detailed proposals including methodology, qualifications, past performance
- Allows negotiations and discussions with offerors
- Common for design-build projects, complex MEP installations

**Key Components**:
- Technical approach and methodology
- Management approach
- Past performance references
- Price/cost proposal (often separate volume)
- Staffing plan with key personnel resumes
- Small business subcontracting plan (if applicable)

**Typical Timeline**: 30-90 days from RFP release to proposal due date

### 1.2 RFQ (Request for Quote)

**When Used**: Simplified acquisitions, typically under $250,000
- Focus on price/delivery terms
- Used when requirements are well-defined
- Faster process with less documentation
- Common for straightforward MEP service contracts

**Typical Timeline**: 7-30 days response window

### 1.3 IFB (Invitation for Bid) / Sealed Bid

**When Used**: Construction projects where lowest price determines winner
- Award to "lowest responsible, responsive bidder"
- No negotiations - price is everything
- Requirements must be clearly defined specifications
- Most common for traditional public works construction

**Key Requirements**:
- Bid submitted in sealed envelope
- Public bid opening at specified date/time
- Bid bond required (typically 5-20% of bid amount)
- Firm fixed-price contracts

**Typical Timeline**: 30-60 days from IFB release to bid opening

### 1.4 Sources Sought / RFI (Request for Information)

**Purpose**: Market research before formal solicitation
- Agencies gauge industry interest and capabilities
- Opportunity to shape requirements
- No obligation to respond, but strategic advantage to do so
- May influence small business set-aside decisions

## 2. Compliance Requirements

### 2.1 Prevailing Wage (Davis-Bacon Act)

**Federal Threshold**: Contracts > $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair

**Key Requirements**:
| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|

| Fringe Benefits | Cash equivalent or bona fide fringe benefits |
| Classification | Workers classified by actual work performed (electrician, plumber, pipefitter, etc.) |
| Recordkeeping | Maintain payrolls for 3 years after project completion |
| Certified Payroll | Weekly submission using WH-347 form |

**Common MEP Classifications**:
- Electrician (journeyworker/apprentice)
