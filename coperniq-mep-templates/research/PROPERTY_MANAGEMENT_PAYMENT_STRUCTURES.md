# Property Management & Multi-Family MEP Payment Structures

**Research Date**: 2025-12-21
**Purpose**: Understand payment models, billing cycles, and service level expectations for MEP contractors serving property management sectors

---

## Executive Summary

Property management MEP work differs fundamentally from traditional project-based construction:
- **Recurring revenue focus**: Annual contracts with monthly/quarterly billing cycles
- **Service level guarantees**: Response times often more important than pricing
- **Relationship-driven**: Master Service Agreements (MSAs) create long-term partnerships
- **Predictable budgeting**: Property managers value flat-rate and APA (Average Per Apartment) models
- **Emergency premium rates**: After-hours work commands 1.5x-2x standard rates

**Key Finding**: Property managers prioritize reliability, response time, and predictable costs over lowest bid pricing.

## 4. Commercial Property Management (Office/Retail)

### Triple Net (NNN) Lease Pass-Through

#### Understanding NNN Structure

**Tenant Responsibilities in NNN Lease**:
- **Base Rent**: Fixed monthly amount to landlord
- **Property Taxes**: Pro-rata share based on square footage
- **Property Insurance**: Pro-rata share
- **CAM (Common Area Maintenance)**: Pro-rata share of operating expenses

**Pro-Rata Calculation**:
```
Tenant's CAM Share = (Tenant SF / Total Rentable SF) × Total CAM Costs

Example:
- Tenant leases 5,000 SF
- Building total: 50,000 SF
- Annual CAM costs: $250,000
- Tenant pays: (5,000/50,000) × $250,000 = $25,000/year ($2,083/month)
```

**Reference**: [CAM Charges Explained](https://stratafolio.com/understanding-cam-charges-in-commercial-lease-management/) - Details pro-rata share calculations and tenant/landlord responsibilities.

#### A. CAM (Common Area Maintenance) Charge Allocation

**What CAM Includes** (MEP-related):
- HVAC maintenance/repairs for common areas
- Parking lot lighting
- Landscape irrigation systems
- Exterior building lighting
- Common area electrical (lobbies, hallways, restrooms)
- Trash compactor/dumpster electrical
- Security system power

**What CAM Excludes** (Landlord responsibility or separate charge):
- Structural repairs (roof, foundation)
- Capital improvements (new HVAC system)
- Landlord's executive salaries
- Leasing commissions
- Legal fees (except lease enforcement)
- Fines for code violations

**CAM Billing Cycles**:
- **Monthly estimate**: Based on prior year actuals or budget
- **Annual reconciliation**: True-up in Q1 of following year
- **Overage refund**: Within 60 days of reconciliation
- **Underpayment**: Due within 30 days of notice

**Example CAM Reconciliation**:
```
Year 1 Estimate: $2,000/month × 12 = $24,000 paid
Year 1 Actual CAM: $26,500
Tenant owes: $2,500 (due in 30 days)

OR

Year 1 Estimate: $2,000/month × 12 = $24,000 paid
Year 1 Actual CAM: $22,000
Landlord refunds: $2,000 (within 60 days)
```

**CAM Caps and Floors**:
- **Cap**: Limits year-over-year CAM increase to 3-5%
- **Floor**: Prevents CAM from dropping below base year (protects landlord)
- **Controllable vs. Uncontrollable**: Caps often apply only to controllable expenses (management fees, landscaping) not utilities or insurance

**Reference**: [NNN Charges Common Pitfalls](https://www.mdregroup.com/nnn-charges-common-pitfalls-to-avoid/) - Discusses caps, exclusions, and tenant audit rights.

#### B. Tenant Improvement (TI) Billing

**MEP Work in TI Projects**:

**Who Pays**:
1. **Landlord TI Allowance**: $20-$100/SF (negotiated in lease)
2. **Over-Allowance**: Tenant pays for costs exceeding allowance

## 7. What Property Managers Value (Priority Ranking)

### Top 5 Decision Factors (Survey-Based)

Based on industry research and property management surveys:

#### 1. Reliability / Response Time (35% weighting)
- **"If they don't show up, I lose tenants"**
- **Critical metrics**:
  - Emergency response <2 hours (life safety)
  - Urgent response <8 hours (habitability)
  - Callback ratio <5% (first-time fix rate)

**What This Means for MEP Contractors**:
- Invest in dispatch software (ServiceTitan, FieldEdge, Jobber)
- GPS tracking for technicians
- After-hours answering service
- Backup technician coverage (no "I'm on vacation")

**Price Sensitivity**: Property managers will pay 10-20% premium for proven reliability

#### 2. Transparent / Predictable Pricing (25% weighting)
- **"I need to budget 18 months in advance for my board"**
- **Preferred models**:
  - Flat-rate pricing (vs. time & materials)
  - Annual contracts with rate caps
  - Upfront estimates for repairs >$500

**What This Means for MEP Contractors**:
- Provide flat-rate price books (by service type)
- Offer multi-year contracts with 3-5% annual escalation caps
- Electronic proposals (photos, 3-tier options: economy/standard/premium)

**Red Flags for Property Managers**:
- "I'll know when I get there" pricing
- Wide estimate ranges ("$500-$2,000")
- Surprise charges on invoices

#### 3. Insurance / Liability Protection (20% weighting)
- **"I can't risk a lawsuit from a tenant injury"**
- **Required coverage**:
  - General liability: $2M minimum ($5M for large portfolios)
  - Workers comp: Statutory limits (proof of coverage)
  - Auto insurance: $1M per vehicle
  - Professional liability: $1M (for design-build)

**What This Means for MEP Contractors**:
- Certificate of Insurance (COI) auto-send (before each job)
- Additional insured endorsement (name property owner on policy)
- Umbrella policy (shows financial stability)

**Deal Breakers**:
- Expired insurance
- Sub-contractors without their own coverage
- Refusal to provide COI within 24 hours

#### 4. Technology Integration (10% weighting)
- **"I don't want to re-key work orders from email/phone"**
- **Desired integrations**:
  - Yardi, AppFolio, Buildium (property management software)
  - Work order import/export (API or email parsing)
  - Tenant communication (automated appointment scheduling)
  - Invoice upload (attach photos, W9, COI automatically)

**What This Means for MEP Contractors**:
- Use field service software with property management integrations
- Offer tenant self-service portal (for service requests)
- Provide photo documentation (before/after) on every invoice

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Contractors who integrate save property managers 5-10 hours/month
- Reduces billing disputes (photos prove work performed)

#### 5. Preventive Maintenance Mindset (10% weighting)
- **"I want problems found before tenants complain"**
- **Proactive services**:
  - Quarterly HVAC inspections (with recommendation report)
  - Annual electrical panel thermal imaging
  - Plumbing fixture replacement schedules (based on age)

**What This Means for MEP Contractors**:
- Offer preventive maintenance agreements (guaranteed revenue)
- Provide condition reports with photos (build trust)
- Recommend capital planning (HVAC replacement in 3 years = tenant retention)

**Upsell Opportunity**:
- Property managers budget for preventive maintenance
- Easier to sell $3,000/year PM contract than $15,000 emergency replacement

## 8. Recurring Revenue Models (Contractor Perspective)

### Benefits of Subscription/Contract Revenue

**Financial Stability**:
- **Predictable cash flow**: Monthly/quarterly retainer payments
- **Reduced A/R risk**: Contracts paid in advance or Net 15-30 (vs. Net 60-90 for project work)
- **Higher business valuation**: Recurring revenue valued at 3-5x (vs. 1-2x for project-based)

**Operational Efficiency**:
- **Route density**: Service same properties regularly (lower drive time)
- **Labor planning**: Scheduled work (vs. unpredictable emergency calls)
- **Inventory management**: Stock common parts for contract clients

**Competitive Moat**:
- **Switching cost**: Property managers hesitant to change contractors (relationship built)
- **Annual renewals**: 85-95% retention rate (if service is good)
- **Referrals**: Happy property managers refer other portfolio managers

### Typical Contract Structures

#### Option 1: Flat Monthly Retainer + À La Carte

**Example: 100-Unit Apartment Complex**
