# Commercialization Strategy

## The Playbook

```
LEARN at YC SaaS (Coperniq)
      ↓
BUILD templates for free (your learning)
      ↓
PROVE they work in production
      ↓
PRODUCTIZE the templates
      ↓
SELL to competing YC SaaS companies
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Zero-Cost R&D
- Coperniq pays your salary while you learn
- You're solving THEIR problems = real requirements
- No guessing what MEP contractors need

### 2. Production Validation
- Templates tested on real contractor workflows
- Feedback from actual users (Coperniq customers)
- Bugs fixed before you sell

### 3. Domain Expertise Acquisition
- GraphQL schemas for field service
- Form builder patterns
- Service agreement structures
- MEP industry vocabulary

### 4. Competitive Intelligence
- You know Coperniq's gaps
- You know what features competitors need
- You can price against their build costs

## The Stack You're Building

| Layer | What It Is | Commercial Value |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Templates** | Pre-built forms, tasks, plans | $2,500-15,000/sale |
| **Schemas** | Database structures for MEP | Included in Enterprise |
| **Integration** | GraphQL/REST patterns | Custom dev work |
| **Consulting** | "We know this industry" | $150-250/hr |

---

## Ethical Considerations

### What's OK
- Learning industry patterns (public knowledge)
- Building templates (your own work)
- Selling to non-competitors
- General MEP domain expertise

### What's NOT OK
- Coperniq proprietary code
- Customer data
- Internal business metrics
- Trade secrets

**Rule:** If you couldn't figure it out from public APIs and industry knowledge, don't use it.

## Revenue Projections

- 5 Starter @ $2,500 = $12,500
- 4 Pro @ $7,500 = $30,000
- 1 Enterprise @ $15,000 = $15,000
- **Total: $57,500/year** (side income)

### Moderate (25 customers/year)
- 10 Starter = $25,000
- 10 Pro = $75,000
- 5 Enterprise = $75,000
- **Total: $175,000/year** (could go full-time)

### Aggressive (50+ customers)
- Add subscription model
- Add consulting
- **$300,000+/year**

## Risks

1. **Non-compete clause** - Check your employment agreement
2. **Time management** - Don't let side work affect day job
3. **IP questions** - Keep personal work on personal time/equipment
4. **Relationship with Coperniq** - Be transparent if it grows

---

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Check employment agreement for non-compete/IP clauses
2. [ ] Set up separate time/equipment for side work
3. [ ] Build first template in Coperniq (learning only)
4. [ ] Document patterns in portable format
5. [ ] Create landing page (when ready to sell)
